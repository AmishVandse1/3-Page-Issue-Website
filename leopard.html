            <div class="bulletpoints_leopards">Amur leopards are extremely rare to witness in the wild. It's not shocking, given how rare they are, but unfortunate given how exquisite they are. thick, luxurious coats with black rings around them, as well as enormous, fluffy tails that they can encircle to get warm. The good news is that, as a result of earlier conservation efforts, their numbers seem to be recovering after being brought to the brink of extinction. The Amur leopard is a lone, nocturnal hunter that inhabits the vast forests of China and Russia. The hairs on that unusual coat can grow up to 7cm long during the cold winter months. In addition to being brutally persecuted throughout time, irresponsible logging has slowly decimated the Amur leopard's natural range.</div>
            <div class="Factheader_leopard"> Where do they live?</div>
            <div class="bulletpoints_leopards"> Amur leopards stay away from open grasslands and populated regions in favor of mixed Korean pine and deciduous forests. These days, their range is limited to the border regions of northeast China and the Russian Far East, as well as possibly North Korea. With a handful in China, the majority of Amur leopards live in Russia. Their range is less than 2,500 square kilometers, which is less space than Dorset.</div>
            <div class="Factheader_leopard"> Why are they so important?</div>
            <div class="bulletpoints_leopards"> As the top predators in their region, Amur leopards play a vital role in maintaining the proper balance of species in their surroundings. This has an impact on the state of the woods and the surrounding ecosystem, which gives local species and humans access to resources like food and water.</div>
