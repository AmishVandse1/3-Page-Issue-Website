            <div class="bulletpoints_leopards"> The area where mountain gorillas reside has had years of civil upheaval, yet conservation efforts have been successful. Results indicate that the number of people living in the Virunga Massif has increased from 480 in 2010 to 604 now. This indicates that there are more than 1,000 wild gorillas in the world today. The early 1990s Rwandan war and years of civil upheaval in the Democratic Republic of the Congo forced waves of refugees into the area surrounding the Virunga Mountains parks, home to over half of the world's mountain gorilla population. This resulted in habitat damage and poaching. Additionally, rebels now control a portion of the gorilla park where the primates live, making survey and conservation efforts hazardous and challenging. 140 Virunga rangers have lost their lives while performing their duties since 1996.</div>

            <div class="Factheader_leopard"> Why are they so important?</div>
            <div class="bulletpoints_leopards"> Like all other wild species, gorillas are vital to their surroundings. The natural balance in the food chain would be upset in the absence of these large-scale grazers consuming copious amounts of vegetation. The humans that rely on that ecosystem for food, water, and other resources may suffer as a result, as well as other creatures in the vicinity. For those who live close to wild gorillas, ecotourism—a socially and environmentally conscious form of travel that includes properly supervised gorilla viewing excursions—can be a significant source of income.
